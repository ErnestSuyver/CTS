## DTS

DTS is basically a redevelopment of the Nautilus API. 

See [here](https://distributed-text-services.github.io/specifications/) for specifications.

Of special interest is the [collections endpoint](https://distributed-text-services.github.io/specifications/Collections-Endpoint.html) which can be used to retrieve _data_ instead of textparts.
