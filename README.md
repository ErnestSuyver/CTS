### CTS Guidelines

* What is CTS?
* What is CITE?
* What is DTS?
* What are CapiTainS, Nemo, Nautilus, the HookTest?
* How do you make your text CTS compliant and why would you?

This manual answers these questions. It tells you what you need to know about the CTS standards, best practices, and guidelines in order to create CTS compliant text editions and share them on a CTS compliant publishing platform.  

For more details, see the [CTS protocol specification](http://cite-architecture.github.io/cts_spec/), the [CapiTainS](http://capitains.org/) Guidelines, as well as the scholarly literature, for example:

    Blackwell, Christopher W. and Smith, Neel. "The CITE architecture (CTS/CITE) for analysis and alignment" it - Information Technology, vol. 62, no. 2, 2020, pp. 91-98. https://doi.org/10.1515/itit-2019-0044

This manual is a complement to the [TEI]() and [BPT]() Guidelines.
